WEBVTT

1
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:54.365
I don't even know where to begin.

2
00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:58.365
I, I, I guess we can just jump in. Ooh. Can we turn me down?

3
00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.885
Yep. Uh,

4
00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.005
what was your main impact?

5
00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.525
Uh, this Friday?

6
00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:11.925
He, I guess he, he talked, uh, to Mindy

7
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:15.005
and I on Wednesday for maybe three hours.

8
00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:19.845
Uh, and then we jumped back into,

9
00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:21.765
no, that was Thursday morning.

10
00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.725
Thursday night, we jumped into a, a leadership meeting

11
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:29.285
with the, the core leadership of the, of the church.

12
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.245
And his themes were the same, uh,

13
00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.645
securing, uh, a proper marriage

14
00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.885
and getting honey out of the carcass.

15
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:46.815
And it is like the Bible, if,

16
00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.335
if he wants to scream it, he repeats himself.

17
00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:53.695
And Doc was just repeating, I want,

18
00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:56.055
I want marriages in line.

19
00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.495
I want, I want proper marriage.

20
00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:01.375
I want the husbands, uh, properly, uh, aligned.

21
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.495
I want them accurate. I want them.

22
00:02:03.955 --> 00:02:07.655
And so he kept saying that over and over.

23
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:08.775
And I'm like, okay.

24
00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:12.215
I, I'm, I'm hearing, I'm hearing you

25
00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.775
because God's been dealing with me and,

26
00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:19.415
and just the way I manage my home, how it's

27
00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:22.535
crooked and, and God's going.

28
00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:24.335
I want you, I want you straight.

29
00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:26.455
And, and so, uh,

30
00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:30.935
I know it's gonna be a, a process, and it,

31
00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:33.535
and it doesn't happen over overnight.

32
00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.975
Um, I was talking to, to Kevin

33
00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:41.655
and Jackie, I, I feel like a, a hose that

34
00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:47.055
that's stretched out and the fos is on, and it's the grace.

35
00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:50.775
And I've let Mindy just get a little, little trickle.

36
00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:55.455
I feel like a, a plug in the, in the grace for my home.

37
00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:59.565
And, and I can't manage the, uh, the KC

38
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.485
unless that's fixed.

39
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:05.805
And so God's going to get this in line, get,

40
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.245
get this in order, get this straightened out.

41
00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:13.165
And, and so I feel like it's a, a hose that's stretched out,

42
00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:15.005
the water's running a, a trickle,

43
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.925
and then it's gonna just be a little bit more and,

44
00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.245
and a little bit more.

45
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:21.725
And, and then, uh, a deluge for, for my family.

46
00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:25.645
But it can't be all at once. It'll just overwhelm us.

47
00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:29.525
And so, God's patient, thank God, um, as long

48
00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.805
as I can stay in, in, in the process.

49
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:35.685
And I think that's what God's saying,

50
00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:39.485
just stay in the process, uh, be, be,

51
00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.085
be built, be it.

52
00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:45.565
It's okay to, to, to take a, a little while to build this.

53
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.085
Rome wasn't built in the day.

54
00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:51.045
And, and so let's, let's, uh, uh, continue just

55
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:55.205
little by little, a alignment, straightened out.

56
00:03:56.105 --> 00:04:00.285
And, and so that was a, a huge impact for, for me,

57
00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:02.325
um, just to start.

58
00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:06.045
And so, um, next week we will,

59
00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:09.885
we're gonna dive into the, the six points that

60
00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:11.845
that doc laid out for our church.

61
00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:15.725
I want, I want this established. I want that established.

62
00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:19.285
And it, it was like the apostle

63
00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:22.445
weightiness came into our, our, our midst

64
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:26.805
and said, this is how I want you to manage, uh, his letter

65
00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:29.725
to, to CFG

66
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.085
or whatever we're we're gonna be called.

67
00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:35.325
I, I want this established in you,

68
00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:38.685
and you're going to, to, to be successful.

69
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.365
And so we're gonna go through that, um, line upon line and,

70
00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:45.645
and in depth, uh, next Sun Sunday.

71
00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:50.525
So, uh, just be, come prepared to,

72
00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:55.895
to really Hear the,

73
00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:57.935
hear my heart,

74
00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:02.015
what I gathered from Doc.

75
00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:02.375
And

76
00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:10.775
I didn't want this.

77
00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:15.375
I never would have chosen this path,

78
00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:20.095
but Teddy goes, I, God called the,

79
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.935
and he placed the right man.

80
00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:27.575
That's right. And so I'm

81
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.295
wrestling with, I don't want this.

82
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.175
I don't wanna, I don't, I don't want to lead.

83
00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:35.295
I don't want it. I, I hate being in front.

84
00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:40.215
I, I hate, I hate this. I want to be in the back.

85
00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:44.935
I want to. And, And so I,

86
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.455
I want to steward what, what doc brought to us,

87
00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:50.255
and I wanna steward it.

88
00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:54.735
Well, uh, the, he was talking about the seeds

89
00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:56.495
of, of the past.

90
00:05:57.145 --> 00:06:02.005
You know, we, we prayed for years that,

91
00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:06.245
that God would dig up those old whales of, of revival

92
00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:09.645
or that, that were around here, established around here.

93
00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:13.565
And thank God he didn't answer those prayers back then,

94
00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:16.165
because we weren't, we weren't ready for that

95
00:06:17.275 --> 00:06:18.445
when I was in Trinidad.

96
00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:22.405
Doc said he's, I was like a triage, and I've been taken out

97
00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:24.885
and planted into this fertile ground

98
00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:28.445
and a sterile environment for, for growth.

99
00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:30.965
And we can take those seeds of the past now and,

100
00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:32.805
and plant those and,

101
00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.845
and watch them watch that, that old,

102
00:06:37.905 --> 00:06:41.605
the old things that God wanted to do in, in this area, that

103
00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:43.965
that was never really accomplished.

104
00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.045
We can we get to partner with that.

105
00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:50.645
We get to see that stuff, uh, come to pass

106
00:06:51.505 --> 00:06:54.845
my heart's cry for, for revival and,

107
00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:59.165
and just a move of God over this city and, and transforming.

108
00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.565
And, and so it's like, there's hope.

109
00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:05.165
You know, there, there's, there's massive hope that,

110
00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:08.005
that we are where we're supposed to be.

111
00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:11.925
We're secured. We're, we're, we're, uh,

112
00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:15.285
we're, We're okay.

113
00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:20.935
You know? Um, we thank God for Scent Life for,

114
00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:23.415
and, and the leadership that

115
00:07:23.415 --> 00:07:25.175
that's brought us to this place.

116
00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:29.155
We're not done with Scent Life.

117
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.675
We're, we're, it's like this, that core,

118
00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:34.555
it's just getting bigger and bigger.

119
00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:38.155
And, and the grace is, is getting stronger and stronger.

120
00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:41.955
And so that, that's where we're at.

121
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:44.915
I mean, so what did, what did what some

122
00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:47.275
of your guys' impacts, uh, Jason?

123
00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.005
Hello. Hello. Hello.

124
00:07:56.295 --> 00:08:00.515
Hey, there we go. Um, so, uh, me

125
00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:03.875
and Desi met with Doc, you know, just us and him.

126
00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:08.115
And we've been through a lot the past, like year

127
00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:11.155
or two, it's been, hasn't been easy for us, you know,

128
00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:14.075
and a lot of what happened wasn't necessarily our fault.

129
00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:15.675
I like what David said on

130
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.035
how we're not victims, we're overcomers.

131
00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:20.635
Um, but in my heart, I've been like,

132
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:22.435
not okay with how everything went.

133
00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:26.075
And one thing that Doc said to me was

134
00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:27.435
that if you fall under despair

135
00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:29.515
and anger, it's like a circle that you're going in.

136
00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:31.355
And if you go in that circle long enough,

137
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.435
it creates grooves.

138
00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:34.755
And that groove is hard to get out

139
00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:35.955
of once you've made that groove.

140
00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:38.555
And, uh, what he said to me was

141
00:08:38.735 --> 00:08:40.675
to find the honey in the carcass

142
00:08:41.135 --> 00:08:43.075
and to forget the things of the past.

143
00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:46.835
He said to not just not be a victim, he like upped the ante.

144
00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:50.315
He said that you need to not even remember, just forget

145
00:08:50.315 --> 00:08:51.915
what happened in the past and move forward.

146
00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:54.955
And that's something I think that like,

147
00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:57.045
has been said to me a lot of times.

148
00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:59.965
But for some reason when he said it, it clicked.

149
00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:01.805
I think, I think I understood it.

150
00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:03.285
I don't know if it's a grace or what happened,

151
00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:06.365
but like, it started to actually click in my heart of where,

152
00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:09.365
okay, I need to this, it's in the past, I can move forward.

153
00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:10.565
I don't gotta think about that anymore.

154
00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:12.925
And, uh, yeah, that's something that,

155
00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:14.245
that really stuck out to me.

156
00:09:15.445 --> 00:09:17.045
Excellent. Excellent.

157
00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:23.135
Uh, Gary, why your,

158
00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:27.975
Well, I was just thinking about, you know, our walk

159
00:09:27.975 --> 00:09:32.055
with God and the transitions of senior pastors in the past.

160
00:09:32.835 --> 00:09:35.935
And, um, you know, sometimes people flip out, they,

161
00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:37.335
you know, get a little bit crazy

162
00:09:37.435 --> 00:09:39.735
and say, ah, you're, you're not my pastor, or whatever.

163
00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:43.175
But, you know, Greg, as you were talking, it reminded me

164
00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:45.535
of Aaron and Moses.

165
00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:50.335
Moses didn't, wasn't eloquent in speech, but Aaron was,

166
00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:53.455
and God used Aaron to help Moses.

167
00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:56.015
And later on, you know, it was Aaron

168
00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:58.175
and her that lifted up Moses' hands.

169
00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:01.575
Right. And I just want you to know, I want to be a Aaron.

170
00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:04.015
Yeah. For you. Awesome.

171
00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:05.495
I wanna lift up your hands, man.

172
00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:07.975
'cause I'm excited for what God's gonna do. Awesome.

173
00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:11.695
And, uh, we just, we just wanna be a part of that. Yeah.

174
00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:13.455
You know, so, um, so good.

175
00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.255
Ironically, last week we had

176
00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:19.735
to put a water pressure reducer on our plumbing system

177
00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:21.495
because we were at 95 pounds.

178
00:10:21.795 --> 00:10:23.375
Who knew? Mm-hmm. Um,

179
00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:27.055
but there's a scripture talks about lying upon lying precept

180
00:10:27.245 --> 00:10:30.495
upon precept, and there's a deluge

181
00:10:30.495 --> 00:10:31.695
coming to us all the time.

182
00:10:31.695 --> 00:10:35.535
Right. But God has certain things for each individual.

183
00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:38.655
Mm-hmm. And we don't have to feel like, Hey, I have

184
00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:40.935
to understand all this and know all the acronyms

185
00:10:40.935 --> 00:10:43.295
and know everything about Congress and know all this stuff.

186
00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.375
No. It, God speaks to each one of us, what he wants us

187
00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:49.855
to understand and what he wants us to walk in.

188
00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:53.215
And I just think, I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong,

189
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:57.215
but I think that's where I'm at with, um, with this, is

190
00:10:57.215 --> 00:10:59.935
that, you know, it's not gonna happen overnight.

191
00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:03.215
It's, it's, we walk with the Lord. It's a process. Yeah.

192
00:11:03.555 --> 00:11:05.495
We have to understand it's a process. Yeah.

193
00:11:05.595 --> 00:11:07.735
And God is faithful to help us see

194
00:11:08.295 --> 00:11:09.295
Absolutely. What the

195
00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:11.415
process is for us individually. Absolutely.

196
00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:14.055
Um, doc is a comedian. He's so funny.

197
00:11:14.595 --> 00:11:18.695
Um, he just made it so light and so, um, down to earth.

198
00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:21.095
And so, you know, matter of fact,

199
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.575
and, uh, his speaking with us, spending time

200
00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:27.175
with us was amazing.

201
00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:29.095
Yeah. I mean, he could have been in any

202
00:11:29.095 --> 00:11:32.095
of 9,000 churches across the globe, and he came and,

203
00:11:32.235 --> 00:11:35.735
and he, he cares about what's going on with Right.

204
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:38.375
Us. Right. Which is amazing. So. Absolutely.

205
00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:40.775
And it's just covered with wisdom,

206
00:11:40.775 --> 00:11:43.895
because it's not, it's not one of those things

207
00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:44.975
that's gonna happen overnight.

208
00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.175
There's a process, and that's the wisdom of God. Yeah.

209
00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:50.855
There's a process that we, we all have to go through.

210
00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:53.055
You're going through, we're, we're going through,

211
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:54.685
we just have to keep that in mind.

212
00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:57.125
It's not gonna happen like overnight. Yeah.

213
00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:58.565
It's, it's a process. Right.

214
00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:01.365
So, right. And that's what Doc said, um,

215
00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:02.405
when I was in Trinidad.

216
00:12:02.405 --> 00:12:06.325
He goes, my, my personal process is your process.

217
00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:08.725
Your process is my process.

218
00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:12.205
We, we get to partner together, you know? And so, yeah.

219
00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:16.885
That's beautiful. Uh, Bob, and then, and then Nick,

220
00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.905
I, uh, found it interesting, uh, Friday night

221
00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:28.305
as Doc shared the, the experience of

222
00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:32.345
how the seed from this region, this area blew

223
00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:35.345
to Trinidad and, and planted there.

224
00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:37.705
And then it grew there,

225
00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:41.145
and now it's coming back into our region through us.

226
00:12:42.275 --> 00:12:45.415
And, uh, so being part of that, that history, I kind

227
00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:46.455
of identify with all that.

228
00:12:46.455 --> 00:12:50.535
But it was neat to see it come around again to

229
00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:52.415
where God is moving in our region.

230
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:56.575
And, uh, and he mentioned that, uh, he wants,

231
00:12:56.595 --> 00:12:58.335
and then it said in Parentes, God wants,

232
00:12:58.395 --> 00:12:59.735
so basically it's the same thing.

233
00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:02.255
Mm-hmm. Doc or God, you know, he wants us

234
00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:03.775
to be light in this area.

235
00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:05.735
Right. And I'm really looking forward

236
00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:09.615
to seeing God expresses light through us as a, maybe

237
00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:11.335
as a catalyst or whatever.

238
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:12.735
I don't know how he's gonna do it,

239
00:13:13.155 --> 00:13:15.015
but we're gonna be light in this region.

240
00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:17.055
Yeah. And that's what I'm looking

241
00:13:17.055 --> 00:13:18.055
Forward to. Yeah, absolutely.

242
00:13:18.055 --> 00:13:22.095
Uh, Nick, go, go to go to Nick.

243
00:13:22.095 --> 00:13:26.695
And then, then, then Mateo.

244
00:13:29.695 --> 00:13:31.375
I, uh, it really stood out

245
00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:32.535
to me when he was talking about sight

246
00:13:33.155 --> 00:13:37.415
and, um, um, you know, uh, from that verse in Ephesians

247
00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:40.535
and the, the, uh, kind of prophetic story that he gave of,

248
00:13:40.635 --> 00:13:43.495
um, of him driving down the highway in sight.

249
00:13:43.995 --> 00:13:48.015
And one thing he said was that, um, uh,

250
00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:52.375
spiritual site is not connected to like, um, intellect

251
00:13:52.555 --> 00:13:56.535
or like, or, um, uh, natural intellect.

252
00:13:56.915 --> 00:14:00.135
And that, that really struck a chord with me

253
00:14:00.135 --> 00:14:03.615
because, uh, personally, uh, part of my makeup is I tend

254
00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:06.095
to excel at intellectual capacity.

255
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.375
Yeah. Uh, but I, what I really,

256
00:14:10.525 --> 00:14:12.895
what I really heard was that, um, that's not the,

257
00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.655
that's not the, even the starting point of,

258
00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:16.415
of spiritual sight and,

259
00:14:16.715 --> 00:14:18.935
and the starting point of spiritual sight is,

260
00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:21.015
is grace from the Lord and revelation from the Lord.

261
00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:27.135
And so, um, that really, um, birthed a desire for

262
00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:31.175
that deeper in my heart of, of Lord I can, I'd rather,

263
00:14:31.595 --> 00:14:35.495
you know, give up any intellectual capacity

264
00:14:35.495 --> 00:14:37.335
or whatever if I can gain spiritual sight. Yeah.

265
00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:38.815
Good. Devin.

266
00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:48.135
Um, so before I,

267
00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:51.245
before I talk about my impact from Doc,

268
00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:53.365
lemme give you a little bit of background, which goes back

269
00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:57.165
to when we first got started with Congress, um, Congress,

270
00:14:57.835 --> 00:14:59.205
this sign right here in front of us,

271
00:14:59.205 --> 00:15:00.685
faith-based global human development.

272
00:15:01.515 --> 00:15:03.885
It's what I do at work is I lead teams

273
00:15:04.265 --> 00:15:06.925
and we figure out how to do business better,

274
00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:08.285
blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.

275
00:15:08.285 --> 00:15:10.205
So I'm like, Lord, what is that?

276
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:13.445
I want, I want gimme side of that Lord.

277
00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:15.565
Um, like,

278
00:15:15.565 --> 00:15:18.085
how do I bring you into my workplace in a new way instead

279
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.125
of just like being able to talk to people or whatever.

280
00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:22.005
Lord, how do I impart your heart

281
00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.805
and your character to people

282
00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:25.765
around me when I'm kind of not supposed to?

283
00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:28.045
Right. You know, I'm not supposed to do that at work.

284
00:15:28.185 --> 00:15:32.005
So anyway, um, so then, uh,

285
00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:35.765
in the, the sector diagram, the doc was talking about,

286
00:15:35.765 --> 00:15:37.645
there's GCT in there in the business section.

287
00:15:37.825 --> 00:15:39.725
I'm like, oh, this is really interesting. Okay, Lord.

288
00:15:39.725 --> 00:15:43.005
And I get connected with, uh, Chelsea early, early on, like,

289
00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:44.765
Chelsea, tell me more about the GCT.

290
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.885
How does this work? What do we need to do about it?

291
00:15:47.505 --> 00:15:49.165
And basically what she said was,

292
00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:50.725
don't worry about it for right now.

293
00:15:51.425 --> 00:15:52.605
And I was like, Lord, that's not

294
00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:53.685
the answer I was looking for.

295
00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.325
Um, because we now have resource around us.

296
00:15:57.325 --> 00:15:59.605
And I'm like, please, Lord, I wanna be resourced for this.

297
00:15:59.705 --> 00:16:02.925
But it took another seven years until everything

298
00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:05.405
that's happened, until the past were cleared,

299
00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:07.365
until my heart was in the right place,

300
00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:10.005
and obstacles were out of the way.

301
00:16:10.305 --> 00:16:15.285
Um, and, uh, so, uh, she came a month ago

302
00:16:15.905 --> 00:16:18.805
and met with us, uh, met with people who wanted

303
00:16:18.805 --> 00:16:20.645
to be in the GCT and kind of talked about what that was.

304
00:16:20.645 --> 00:16:24.165
And yesterday we did our GCT kickoff,

305
00:16:24.385 --> 00:16:26.205
our first meeting with just us.

306
00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.885
And really what we went over was we just went over her

307
00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:31.365
material again, and then talked about some things

308
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:32.405
that are specific to us

309
00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:34.685
and how we need to do things to help support Greg.

310
00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:37.685
Um, and Greg

311
00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:39.445
and I are gonna have more conversations about other

312
00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:41.445
specifics, things that we need to figure out that are,

313
00:16:41.715 --> 00:16:43.725
it's gonna cost me money, is what he's saying.

314
00:16:43.725 --> 00:16:46.765
You need test. That is actually not what I said.

315
00:16:48.745 --> 00:16:52.685
But, um, the, the thing that the Lord had been, uh,

316
00:16:52.735 --> 00:16:56.965
impressing on me since we went up to Vasilis house was, um,

317
00:16:57.555 --> 00:16:59.365
like building the next generation.

318
00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:02.765
And so the, my big takeaway from, I mean, I took

319
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:03.805
so much away from Doc,

320
00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:06.565
but, um, he was talking about the youth

321
00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.445
and really, you know, how we have

322
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.845
to have generational succession.

323
00:17:10.505 --> 00:17:12.765
And, uh, and that's part of what I shared with the, uh,

324
00:17:12.825 --> 00:17:15.245
the group yesterday, is that that's, uh, to me,

325
00:17:15.245 --> 00:17:18.965
the next generation isn't just the, the youth alone, it's

326
00:17:19.525 --> 00:17:22.205
everyone that's involved in what we're doing with GCT

327
00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:24.725
and GCT isn't just sound

328
00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:26.805
and zoom kind of, that's the obvious part,

329
00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:29.085
but there's a whole bunch of other things that we need to do

330
00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:30.525
as a GCT to support

331
00:17:30.755 --> 00:17:32.205
what happens here in the kingdom community.

332
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.525
So, um, just that whole thing about generational succession

333
00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:38.445
and, um, God's really, you know,

334
00:17:38.445 --> 00:17:39.885
giving me, he's giving Greg too.

335
00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:43.325
He's giving me like a whole new fresh perspective on

336
00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:45.885
what it means to build and orchestrate

337
00:17:45.905 --> 00:17:47.045
and bring people together

338
00:17:47.145 --> 00:17:49.165
and say, let's all move together in a forward

339
00:17:49.165 --> 00:17:50.325
direction along this highway.

340
00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:53.125
And, and I just also wanna say really quick,

341
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.685
that number five to me is just a big deal about being

342
00:17:55.685 --> 00:17:57.165
confident, hearing the voice of God.

343
00:17:57.195 --> 00:17:59.765
That is just, that's, uh, an integral part of

344
00:17:59.765 --> 00:18:01.805
what we all have to do as a community.

345
00:18:02.185 --> 00:18:03.885
And it was just so great to have Doc here.

346
00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:05.965
Like we said, he just, he took time out

347
00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:07.285
of his incredibly busy schedule

348
00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:10.645
and the billions of flight miles that he has to succumb to

349
00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:14.045
a 60 person church in Vancouver, Canada.

350
00:18:14.345 --> 00:18:17.045
Oh, Vancouver, Washington. So anyway, yeah.

351
00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:19.845
Yeah, Susan. Alright.

352
00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:22.205
There was a few things that stuck out to me.

353
00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:25.725
Um, but you covered it with, um, just the marriages

354
00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:30.325
and something that he said on Friday night about, um,

355
00:18:31.035 --> 00:18:33.845
that there shouldn't be any chambers of your husband's heart

356
00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:36.285
that isn't open to you except for one.

357
00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.205
And that was where the Holy Spirit speaks to him.

358
00:18:39.225 --> 00:18:40.405
And it kind of got to me.

359
00:18:40.405 --> 00:18:43.765
And then he was talking about, um, wives, how we nag about,

360
00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:45.365
oh, there's a stoplight, there's this,

361
00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:49.805
and it's got to me about like, am I, do I try

362
00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:51.445
and be his personal Holy Spirit?

363
00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:52.885
Like, Hey, you need to stop here,

364
00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:54.005
or Hey, you need to go that way.

365
00:18:54.465 --> 00:18:58.085
And really just letting him, like, as a wife, open that up.

366
00:18:58.185 --> 00:18:59.765
So he's leading me

367
00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:02.125
and I'm not saying, Hey, there's a stoplight over there,

368
00:19:02.305 --> 00:19:03.685
or there's a red light over there.

369
00:19:03.745 --> 00:19:05.085
We can't go that way. Yeah.

370
00:19:05.265 --> 00:19:08.685
Um, but then also just that there's that sweetness

371
00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:10.685
of the honey that's gonna go forward.

372
00:19:11.075 --> 00:19:14.005
Yeah. That we've already had all the dead, um,

373
00:19:14.305 --> 00:19:16.485
and gone through all that, but moving forward,

374
00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:17.965
it's just gonna be the sweetness.

375
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.125
Yeah. Right. Um,

376
00:19:19.665 --> 00:19:21.685
and then the other thing was the trans, um,

377
00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:23.645
he talked about transactions in

378
00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:26.005
our meeting on Thursday night with the leaders,

379
00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.485
and he said that, um,

380
00:19:29.075 --> 00:19:31.405
there's a constant transaction with God.

381
00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:34.245
He, you're asking for sight, but what are we gonna give him?

382
00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:35.805
We're gonna give him faith or we're,

383
00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:37.165
are we gonna spend time in our word?

384
00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.645
Um, so it's a transaction, transaction that has

385
00:19:40.645 --> 00:19:42.845
to completely always be mo moving.

386
00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:46.325
There's always something that he's gonna give us, but in,

387
00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:47.405
but we have to go

388
00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:50.005
and give him something, um, with that. Yeah.

389
00:19:50.145 --> 00:19:51.925
That's so good. Yeah.

390
00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:56.925
Back to the, uh, wives get, get access to every area

391
00:19:56.985 --> 00:20:01.925
of, uh, the man's heart except for the one, uh, when I went

392
00:20:01.925 --> 00:20:03.125
through my process back

393
00:20:04.285 --> 00:20:08.965
whenever, uh, I was very guarded in, in with how I

394
00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:11.205
let Mindy into my heart.

395
00:20:12.065 --> 00:20:16.525
And, uh, I knew that, that the, the,

396
00:20:16.525 --> 00:20:19.765
what God was putting his finger on was you got,

397
00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:22.285
you just have to let that that go be.

398
00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:25.445
But it was like, if I do, it's my vulnerability.

399
00:20:25.595 --> 00:20:27.125
It's showing her my weakness.

400
00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:32.125
And, and, and, uh, once I let her in,

401
00:20:34.765 --> 00:20:36.025
she was like, that, that's it.

402
00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:39.345
That, that, that was, that was all, uh, that, that you did.

403
00:20:39.765 --> 00:20:42.625
And I'm like, man, that's so huge. And, and she's like that.

404
00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:47.285
That's it. And at that, at that point, that's when God began

405
00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:48.645
to, to heal.

406
00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:50.965
He, he came in and,

407
00:20:51.225 --> 00:20:55.885
and it was like, just erased the, the guilt,

408
00:20:56.105 --> 00:21:00.445
the shame, the, the, all the stuff that I was carrying.

409
00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:05.565
And so there, there, there's freedom in the, um,

410
00:21:07.085 --> 00:21:10.135
letting your wife walk through your heart,

411
00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:11.815
have every, every area.

412
00:21:11.815 --> 00:21:13.655
Because if you can't do it with your wife,

413
00:21:13.655 --> 00:21:14.775
you're not doing it with God.

414
00:21:16.795 --> 00:21:20.775
So you're, he wants every, everything, like, doc is praying,

415
00:21:21.475 --> 00:21:23.095
go through the precincts of my heart,

416
00:21:23.555 --> 00:21:25.255
but we have all these doors closed.

417
00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:26.775
Don't, don't touch that one.

418
00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.695
Don't, don't go in, don't go there.

419
00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:32.615
Don't, don't you dare, uh, uh, access that one. No.

420
00:21:32.615 --> 00:21:33.655
That, that one's too painful.

421
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.535
But if we open all these doors, he,

422
00:21:36.675 --> 00:21:38.735
he knows the perfect timing to go into 'em.

423
00:21:39.835 --> 00:21:44.495
And, and so if we can leave those access doors open for him,

424
00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:47.175
we'd need to do that for our wives,

425
00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:50.415
because that is, is how

426
00:21:51.355 --> 00:21:53.175
we manage, you know?

427
00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:55.975
And, and so that was a huge impact for me too.

428
00:21:56.395 --> 00:22:00.375
The leaving every, every area open for your wife.

429
00:22:01.035 --> 00:22:04.415
No hiddenness, no hiddenness from your, from your family,

430
00:22:04.515 --> 00:22:05.695
no hiddenness from your wife.

431
00:22:06.115 --> 00:22:10.855
Of course, you, you don't have to tell her the, the per,

432
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:13.735
you know, the deeper personal stuff that, that

433
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:18.295
I think God is just wants that.

434
00:22:18.315 --> 00:22:23.295
That's, that's where he goes. You know? So yeah.

435
00:22:23.295 --> 00:22:24.295
That was a big impact.

436
00:22:27.945 --> 00:22:28.945
Mateo,

437
00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:32.295
I'm next and then, Oh, DJ's next.

438
00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:35.615
Yeah, DJ's got the mag preacher, preacher.

439
00:22:35.915 --> 00:22:39.895
Um, one of the things that stood out to me is kind of

440
00:22:39.895 --> 00:22:43.535
what you talked about with just, um, being,

441
00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:46.095
having well-built marriages, families and,

442
00:22:46.315 --> 00:22:48.495
and it starts with being built as a man.

443
00:22:49.195 --> 00:22:54.095
Um, and then one of the things that he had talked about was

444
00:22:55.105 --> 00:22:57.735
being in the, the survival mode and,

445
00:22:57.835 --> 00:23:00.455
and stabilization mode for us,

446
00:23:00.515 --> 00:23:03.655
and how scent life had come alongside of us and,

447
00:23:03.795 --> 00:23:05.615
and helped build us and everything.

448
00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:09.015
Mm-hmm. And, uh, one of the things

449
00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:12.815
that I was thinking about was we're gonna go from

450
00:23:13.655 --> 00:23:15.815
survival mode to flourishing.

451
00:23:16.285 --> 00:23:21.015
Yeah. And so, um, what

452
00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:23.215
that, I kind of looked up what that meant,

453
00:23:23.755 --> 00:23:26.335
and it says, um, a deeper state

454
00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:29.175
of wellbeing involving growth, purpose

455
00:23:29.435 --> 00:23:31.535
and optimal ization.

456
00:23:32.555 --> 00:23:37.215
And so in a way, this kind of starts the next chapter

457
00:23:37.235 --> 00:23:38.335
of our journey Yeah.

458
00:23:38.565 --> 00:23:42.935
This weekend. And I just felt, um, just with meeting

459
00:23:42.935 --> 00:23:44.095
with Doc on Thursday night

460
00:23:44.095 --> 00:23:47.325
and just with the meeting on Friday, just walking away

461
00:23:47.355 --> 00:23:49.405
with this huge encouragement.

462
00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:52.245
So Yeah. Good. Mateo.

463
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:01.445
Well, kind of kind of related to

464
00:24:01.445 --> 00:24:02.765
what you were saying, couple others.

465
00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:04.285
Hold, hold the mic up just a little bit

466
00:24:04.905 --> 00:24:06.245
so they can hear on the Zoom.

467
00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:12.205
Oh, okay. Um, I just think God's timing is incredible.

468
00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:16.245
You know, um, first of all, I believe that everything

469
00:24:16.245 --> 00:24:18.365
that we've gone through, whether we understand it

470
00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:21.805
or not, is part of God's plan all the way through.

471
00:24:22.705 --> 00:24:27.565
And, um, I've been doing some studying in, uh, in Genesis.

472
00:24:28.065 --> 00:24:32.525
And if I, if I look at all of Genesis, the, um,

473
00:24:34.185 --> 00:24:36.925
the main theme of that is journey.

474
00:24:37.505 --> 00:24:41.325
Uh, at its journey, it's individual journeys within,

475
00:24:42.505 --> 00:24:46.045
uh, the larger journey of the body of Christ within

476
00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:47.685
the purpose of God.

477
00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:50.925
And here we are in this journey.

478
00:24:51.035 --> 00:24:54.125
It's actually been kind of short accelerated,

479
00:24:54.545 --> 00:24:56.445
but God comes in at this time when,

480
00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:59.685
when we've been stabilizing and, and,

481
00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.365
and he says, okay, now it's time.

482
00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:05.005
And, and, uh, is that you? Yeah.

483
00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:09.205
Um, and it, and it kind of was a surprise,

484
00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:11.405
but it, it brings hope.

485
00:25:11.705 --> 00:25:15.405
It, uh, it brings strength for, for the mission.

486
00:25:16.785 --> 00:25:21.125
And I want to add that I, I didn't expect, um, him to bring,

487
00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:23.845
uh, you know, Greg in and,

488
00:25:23.865 --> 00:25:26.605
and process him into that se place.

489
00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:29.645
But, but there's a strength in that.

490
00:25:30.565 --> 00:25:32.885
I think God uses everything.

491
00:25:32.985 --> 00:25:37.125
But I think that's needed for us, that, that having

492
00:25:38.005 --> 00:25:40.605
somebody from within grow and,

493
00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:45.285
and, um, be his instrument is essential.

494
00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.245
Oh, shoot. My notes are gone.

495
00:25:50.505 --> 00:25:54.805
Um, what was the other thing? Oh, okay.

496
00:25:54.945 --> 00:25:56.685
So journey within Journeys. Right.

497
00:25:56.705 --> 00:25:57.765
So we're, we're, I,

498
00:25:58.035 --> 00:26:00.045
I've been focused on my own little journey

499
00:26:00.065 --> 00:26:01.605
and it's been hard to step out of that.

500
00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:03.645
But now since Doc came

501
00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.645
and told us all about, uh,

502
00:26:07.705 --> 00:26:10.325
the Pacific Northwest and the part we played

503
00:26:10.345 --> 00:26:12.485
and the play part that they played in us,

504
00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:14.645
and it's, it's God looking down

505
00:26:14.665 --> 00:26:17.245
and saying, okay, let's do this thing in

506
00:26:17.245 --> 00:26:18.325
the Pacific Northwest.

507
00:26:18.505 --> 00:26:19.605
Here's what I want to see.

508
00:26:20.025 --> 00:26:22.045
And he, and that goes and it trickles down.

509
00:26:22.945 --> 00:26:26.805
And, um, so now we have this mission takes our eyes off

510
00:26:26.805 --> 00:26:28.125
of our own personal journey

511
00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:30.885
and places it back journey within the journey.

512
00:26:31.855 --> 00:26:35.345
We're not serving here,

513
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:37.505
we're serving universally.

514
00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:40.625
And, um, that there's so much strength in that.

515
00:26:41.605 --> 00:26:42.825
And I had some other things, but

516
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:44.875
They're gone now. Good.

517
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.365
Good. Isabel,

518
00:26:53.735 --> 00:26:55.845
maybe we'll get Toby going back and forth.

519
00:26:55.855 --> 00:26:57.605
We'll, we'll pick someone over here.

520
00:26:59.305 --> 00:27:02.725
Um, there were two things that really impacted me.

521
00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:04.685
Um, we already covered one of them,

522
00:27:04.685 --> 00:27:06.645
which was the honey and the carcass.

523
00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:12.045
But really the sentence that really meant a lot to me was,

524
00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:14.005
it's time to find the honey.

525
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:18.325
Um, 'cause like it's been repeated,

526
00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:19.965
like I already know the honey is there,

527
00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:22.165
like this was told to us before.

528
00:27:23.105 --> 00:27:27.005
Um, and like, I just being told

529
00:27:27.985 --> 00:27:31.245
by the Lord through dog that it's time to find that honey.

530
00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:34.645
It's there. It's all I need to do is take that step

531
00:27:35.145 --> 00:27:38.765
or take that, um, like partnership with the Lord

532
00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:42.525
to like grab it and use it and taste it.

533
00:27:43.155 --> 00:27:44.285
Yeah. Um,

534
00:27:45.385 --> 00:27:47.645
and the other one was, um,

535
00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:50.925
it was very convicting to me.

536
00:27:50.925 --> 00:27:53.445
It was, um, can I trust you? Yeah.

537
00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:58.605
And, um, for me, that was major

538
00:27:59.005 --> 00:28:02.325
'cause um, it's been in my heart, um,

539
00:28:04.635 --> 00:28:07.205
Like the, I don't know how to say it,

540
00:28:07.205 --> 00:28:11.125
but how, um, that goal, that treasure that the Lord has,

541
00:28:11.235 --> 00:28:12.325
like, that's been in my heart.

542
00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:17.525
And for me to hear that, that was

543
00:28:18.235 --> 00:28:20.965
huge because I saw the Lord telling me

544
00:28:21.755 --> 00:28:24.045
there's alignment that needs to be done.

545
00:28:24.155 --> 00:28:26.925
There's, um, like when you mentioned the access doors needed

546
00:28:26.925 --> 00:28:31.565
to be open, um, like immediately God pointed out like,

547
00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:36.165
these doors need to be open in your heart for me to enter.

548
00:28:36.305 --> 00:28:39.925
Mm-hmm. And, um, so now with that, like, I'm just

549
00:28:41.155 --> 00:28:43.285
receiving that and hearing that and just, I'm ready.

550
00:28:43.475 --> 00:28:46.605
Yeah. That's awesome. And, um, with that go follows

551
00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:50.605
to the third, which I is my excitement to see you

552
00:28:51.185 --> 00:28:55.645
and Mindy as our, um, new leaders, our senior elders.

553
00:28:56.205 --> 00:28:58.205
'cause when I heard that immediately

554
00:28:58.225 --> 00:28:59.365
my spirit was like, yes.

555
00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:02.725
And I like wholeheartedly partner.

556
00:29:03.295 --> 00:29:05.205
We'll partner with you and with the Lord.

557
00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:07.765
And I want you guys to hear that from me

558
00:29:07.765 --> 00:29:11.405
and know that like, we are here

559
00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:14.525
and partnering with the Lord, hearing with the Lord

560
00:29:14.525 --> 00:29:16.525
with you, and we'll support you all the way.

561
00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:20.205
That's awesome. So if you turn to judges, 14

562
00:29:25.775 --> 00:29:30.765
verse eight, Samson,

563
00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:34.045
it's the, the story about the, the lion.

564
00:29:34.505 --> 00:29:39.365
But this really stuck out to me chapter, uh, 14

565
00:29:40.015 --> 00:29:41.645
verse eight later.

566
00:29:41.945 --> 00:29:45.405
He, he returned to MNA for the wedding.

567
00:29:45.985 --> 00:29:49.565
He turned off the path to look for at the carcass

568
00:29:51.065 --> 00:29:54.165
in, in the, uh, message Bible.

569
00:29:54.265 --> 00:29:55.485
It says he took a detour.

570
00:29:58.345 --> 00:30:00.565
And so he wasn't just walking down the road.

571
00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:01.845
And he's like, oh yeah, there's that lion.

572
00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:04.685
But he had to go purposely over, way over.

573
00:30:04.885 --> 00:30:06.885
I don't know how far that that detour was

574
00:30:06.945 --> 00:30:08.005
to go find that lion.

575
00:30:10.505 --> 00:30:15.365
And I, I really am tired

576
00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:18.325
of saying, yeah, we're a church that,

577
00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:20.645
that the pastor decided to leave

578
00:30:20.705 --> 00:30:22.205
and we're just dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

579
00:30:22.745 --> 00:30:27.405
And giving them a little smell of the,

580
00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.525
the carcass that, that we came out of.

581
00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:33.405
And he said, go, put your hand in there.

582
00:30:36.115 --> 00:30:38.805
Take the honey, get strength.

583
00:30:41.115 --> 00:30:43.165
That was the one for me.

584
00:30:44.265 --> 00:30:48.265
Second, taking it to whoever

585
00:30:49.285 --> 00:30:50.345
and giving them strength.

586
00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:54.105
And so he's saying, be done,

587
00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:59.345
be done with, with that stuff.

588
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:03.265
And I've taken my detour.

589
00:31:03.815 --> 00:31:07.185
I've stuck my hand in the honey and I'm strengthened.

590
00:31:08.765 --> 00:31:10.185
And that's what he's saying to you guys,

591
00:31:13.525 --> 00:31:14.845
Isabelle, go find that.

592
00:31:16.035 --> 00:31:18.565
Take the detour where you got off path,

593
00:31:18.675 --> 00:31:21.085
because the lion, he had to be off path

594
00:31:21.085 --> 00:31:25.045
because that's where the lion came and, and went to attack.

595
00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:29.685
And then, so he had to go back, go back to, to where that is

596
00:31:30.065 --> 00:31:33.165
and, and put your hand in that.

597
00:31:33.675 --> 00:31:37.045
Okay. That's for everybody.

598
00:31:40.105 --> 00:31:45.085
The wounds, what the, whatever it's done.

599
00:31:45.865 --> 00:31:49.245
We can walk out, just like Doc said,

600
00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:51.205
leave the plantation.

601
00:31:52.355 --> 00:31:56.945
Just go the guys,

602
00:31:57.245 --> 00:31:59.025
we, we met, uh,

603
00:32:00.905 --> 00:32:03.065
I don't know when it was growth group night

604
00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:04.065
or whatever day that was.

605
00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:08.325
Clean slate. It's done.

606
00:32:09.865 --> 00:32:12.125
You don't have to live in that anymore.

607
00:32:16.525 --> 00:32:17.665
The work's finished.

608
00:32:22.015 --> 00:32:24.395
So, uh, Davin

609
00:32:24.535 --> 00:32:25.755
Really quick on the honey.

610
00:32:25.815 --> 00:32:28.115
One of the big things that I took away from

611
00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:30.795
that is when Doc was talking about, um,

612
00:32:31.975 --> 00:32:35.035
how s Samson gave his parents some of the honey,

613
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:37.435
and there's no stench on it.

614
00:32:38.015 --> 00:32:41.485
And that really birthed, um, I have hope for my kids

615
00:32:41.865 --> 00:32:44.205
who aren't walking with the Lord closely right now.

616
00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:49.685
Um, but that gave me a new level of faith that my two, two

617
00:32:49.685 --> 00:32:51.805
of my boys would just be able to be really connected.

618
00:32:51.805 --> 00:32:54.925
That Priscilla and I can share our process now in a,

619
00:32:55.105 --> 00:32:56.485
you know, season where we couldn't before,

620
00:32:57.105 --> 00:33:01.765
but, uh, that there may be some, you know, restoration, some

621
00:33:02.365 --> 00:33:04.405
whatever God wants, you know, in that. So, yeah.

622
00:33:04.715 --> 00:33:09.485
Good. Mindy, It was on the same

623
00:33:09.835 --> 00:33:10.965
line as what you were saying.

624
00:33:11.025 --> 00:33:15.925
The the verse said, um, uh, he came

625
00:33:15.925 --> 00:33:18.205
to his father and mother and gave, um, some

626
00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:19.725
to them, and they also ate.

627
00:33:20.105 --> 00:33:21.965
But they, but he did not tell them

628
00:33:21.965 --> 00:33:24.445
that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.

629
00:33:24.795 --> 00:33:28.285
They probably had no idea that, you know, not only

630
00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:30.925
that the honey came from there,

631
00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:33.245
but that the lion even existed in the first place.

632
00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:38.325
That doesn't, that had nothing to do with, um, how God used

633
00:33:38.355 --> 00:33:41.845
that situation to bring strength to his family, um,

634
00:33:42.065 --> 00:33:43.165
and to share with others.

635
00:33:43.305 --> 00:33:46.525
And so as we move forward, um, we can grab that honey,

636
00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:48.005
we can be strengthened by it.

637
00:33:48.265 --> 00:33:52.525
Um, and then moving forward, I mean that, that stain of

638
00:33:52.525 --> 00:33:56.525
where it came from, it doesn't even touch the, the blessing

639
00:33:56.525 --> 00:33:58.965
and the flow of grace in our lives moving forward.

640
00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:02.605
Um, we don't have to ever even share, you know, where

641
00:34:02.605 --> 00:34:03.685
that honey came from.

642
00:34:04.505 --> 00:34:07.005
It can be, you know, just this thing that's kind of deep

643
00:34:07.005 --> 00:34:09.605
inside of us that strengthens our faith, um,

644
00:34:09.825 --> 00:34:13.565
but never has to touch, uh, you know, those who

645
00:34:13.565 --> 00:34:16.005
that strength is gonna be poured out to. Yeah.

646
00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:16.965
Yeah.

647
00:34:22.085 --> 00:34:23.725
I love what everybody's sharing.

648
00:34:24.425 --> 00:34:28.125
So strengthening in our meeting, uh, with Rob, Rob and I

649
00:34:28.125 --> 00:34:31.445
and Doc, he talked about the apostolic

650
00:34:32.185 --> 00:34:37.085
and told us a story of what the apostolic is like.

651
00:34:37.305 --> 00:34:38.685
And he had a vision and,

652
00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:42.965
and saw blocks that were all, um, out of order.

653
00:34:43.425 --> 00:34:46.405
And he stuck his hand and put the blocks in order.

654
00:34:46.405 --> 00:34:48.885
He just knew, and they were children's blocks.

655
00:34:49.865 --> 00:34:52.325
Um, and he said, that's significant.

656
00:34:52.945 --> 00:34:55.165
And that I have the ability to go in

657
00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:57.525
and put things in their proper order.

658
00:34:57.585 --> 00:34:59.645
That's what the apostolics like mm-hmm.

659
00:35:01.355 --> 00:35:04.455
And everything else, he said a bunch of different things,

660
00:35:04.515 --> 00:35:07.695
but everything else came from that.

661
00:35:08.355 --> 00:35:11.215
And in my life, personally, questions

662
00:35:11.215 --> 00:35:12.895
that he has no idea that I have.

663
00:35:13.475 --> 00:35:16.655
As he spoke, those blocks were set in order in my own

664
00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:18.215
heart, in my marriage.

665
00:35:18.345 --> 00:35:19.935
Those things were set in order.

666
00:35:20.315 --> 00:35:22.455
And then he came Friday and did it again.

667
00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:26.895
You know, my place in the community, what the, you know,

668
00:35:26.895 --> 00:35:29.655
the history, you know, in, in the eighties

669
00:35:29.655 --> 00:35:31.255
and the nineties, I knew where I was.

670
00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:33.695
I knew what I was doing and how God saved me.

671
00:35:34.115 --> 00:35:36.375
How does a southern California girl get

672
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:37.485
in the Pacific Northwest?

673
00:35:38.125 --> 00:35:41.845
I don't know. Um, only God can do that.

674
00:35:42.025 --> 00:35:44.805
And so the, the zooming in, zooming out,

675
00:35:45.035 --> 00:35:47.045
like it almost felt sick, you know,

676
00:35:47.715 --> 00:35:50.005
like too much motion sickness of it.

677
00:35:50.035 --> 00:35:52.085
It's me, it's us, it's me, it's us. Yeah.

678
00:35:52.145 --> 00:35:53.525
Um, but it was so beautiful

679
00:35:53.825 --> 00:35:58.205
and so powerful that he reached in to each one of us

680
00:35:58.425 --> 00:35:59.885
and to us as a community

681
00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:03.645
and set us solid and right.

682
00:36:03.945 --> 00:36:07.165
And future focused, able to give Yeah.

683
00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:11.125
Honey freely and, and have more than enough. Yeah.

684
00:36:11.395 --> 00:36:15.005
Good, good. Desi.

685
00:36:17.715 --> 00:36:20.765
Okay. Yeah. And then if you're part

686
00:36:20.765 --> 00:36:23.725
of the executive team, you can't skip.

687
00:36:24.345 --> 00:36:28.045
Um, so we'll, we'll call on you if you don't volunteer.

688
00:36:28.345 --> 00:36:29.485
So be prepared.

689
00:36:32.745 --> 00:36:35.005
So in the middle of doc talking,

690
00:36:35.565 --> 00:36:38.405
I don't even know if it was related to anything he said

691
00:36:38.585 --> 00:36:42.285
or not, but God just really impressed on my heart.

692
00:36:42.465 --> 00:36:45.565
And this was Friday night that, um,

693
00:36:45.715 --> 00:36:50.205
I've been living in a state of faithlessness And,

694
00:36:50.665 --> 00:36:53.965
uh, directly related to kind

695
00:36:53.965 --> 00:36:55.005
of what we've been talking about.

696
00:36:55.115 --> 00:36:59.405
Like, so many questions of like, how could this happen?

697
00:37:00.265 --> 00:37:04.845
Why did this happen? Where did I go wrong? How do I move on?

698
00:37:04.945 --> 00:37:06.125
How do I forgive? Mm-hmm.

699
00:37:06.505 --> 00:37:10.925
Um, and just going through those, you know,

700
00:37:11.545 --> 00:37:13.925
things that you do enough times, it becomes a rut.

701
00:37:14.905 --> 00:37:18.685
And God showed me that that's not just innocent questioning,

702
00:37:18.685 --> 00:37:20.325
that's faithlessness.

703
00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:23.565
And he put his finger on that and he identified that.

704
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:28.605
Um, and so then that gives me a choice.

705
00:37:28.865 --> 00:37:32.285
Do I walk knowingly in faithlessness

706
00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:35.725
or do I give it all to him?

707
00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:39.125
Mm-hmm. And it's not, it can't be 99.99%.

708
00:37:39.185 --> 00:37:42.405
It has to be a hundred percent of saying

709
00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:44.565
this was God's will.

710
00:37:44.995 --> 00:37:48.005
This was his sovereignty. He had a plan.

711
00:37:48.515 --> 00:37:51.685
It's not 99.99%. I believe he had a plan.

712
00:37:51.835 --> 00:37:54.045
It's a hundred percent he had a plan.

713
00:37:55.265 --> 00:37:57.645
Um, and it relates so much to that honey.

714
00:37:58.345 --> 00:38:01.605
Um, one thing he said about the honey

715
00:38:02.195 --> 00:38:03.725
that I don't remember him saying

716
00:38:03.725 --> 00:38:06.245
before is that he said, the purpose

717
00:38:06.385 --> 00:38:07.845
of the carcass is the honey.

718
00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:09.285
And that's a direct quote.

719
00:38:10.145 --> 00:38:12.045
And that's a whole different way of seeing it,

720
00:38:12.315 --> 00:38:14.325
because kind of how I understood it

721
00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:16.765
before is like the carcass happens to be there

722
00:38:17.305 --> 00:38:18.445
and it just sucks.

723
00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:20.965
But God can make honey out of it.

724
00:38:21.505 --> 00:38:24.725
But, but no, he said the purpose

725
00:38:25.105 --> 00:38:26.885
of the carcass was the honey.

726
00:38:27.785 --> 00:38:30.405
And that's a hundred percent faith right there. Yeah.

727
00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:36.045
Um, so I shared this with my growth group that I apologized

728
00:38:36.045 --> 00:38:39.965
to him, and I just feel like Friday night

729
00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:41.765
was in my heart.

730
00:38:42.085 --> 00:38:43.845
I was like, okay, I can move on.

731
00:38:44.465 --> 00:38:46.725
And that's just like such a beautiful thing.

732
00:38:46.845 --> 00:38:48.765
I didn't know how I would get to that point,

733
00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:50.965
and I still don't know how he did it.

734
00:38:51.385 --> 00:38:55.685
Um, but in his faithfulness, um,

735
00:38:56.245 --> 00:38:59.405
I feel like I can, that's the past chapter,

736
00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:02.645
like you were saying, and that really hit me what you said,

737
00:39:02.645 --> 00:39:05.885
Greg, because that's how I've been explaining it to people.

738
00:39:06.045 --> 00:39:08.325
I tell them what we went through so

739
00:39:08.325 --> 00:39:09.405
that they understand where we are.

740
00:39:09.955 --> 00:39:12.325
It's like we don't have to, we don't have

741
00:39:12.325 --> 00:39:14.165
to go over the old things we can.

742
00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:18.845
Um, because like Mindy said, like when he brought the honey,

743
00:39:19.265 --> 00:39:20.565
he didn't explain it.

744
00:39:20.705 --> 00:39:22.045
He didn't have to explain it.

745
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:24.365
He just brought it, and there was no

746
00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:25.485
smell of the carcass on it.

747
00:39:26.225 --> 00:39:31.085
Um, and then I just, one thing Megan said to the women,

748
00:39:32.265 --> 00:39:35.205
uh, was that's Jeff's wife.

749
00:39:35.345 --> 00:39:37.765
And so after Jeff shared with the men, she shared

750
00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:40.725
with the women from her perspective, one thing she said

751
00:39:40.725 --> 00:39:43.565
that, um, has just really stuck with me is she said,

752
00:39:43.985 --> 00:39:47.725
he showed me, he has, God showed me, he has the right

753
00:39:47.725 --> 00:39:50.245
to script my life however he sees fit.

754
00:39:50.245 --> 00:39:52.805
Yeah. And I think it's just,

755
00:39:53.025 --> 00:39:56.525
that's the honey is, Is God.

756
00:39:56.905 --> 00:39:59.005
God has his hand, he has the control.

757
00:39:59.555 --> 00:40:03.605
Yeah. That's so beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:40:03.945 --> 00:40:06.005
Uh, Joyce, I,

759
00:40:09.725 --> 00:40:10.725
I think this is a first.

760
00:40:12.665 --> 00:40:16.685
Um, so a couple things that, that really have, um,

761
00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:21.125
that got placed on my heart that I wanted to share is

762
00:40:21.125 --> 00:40:23.925
that we can look back and this whole year

763
00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:27.245
and we can just say, you know, all these things that,

764
00:40:27.345 --> 00:40:28.885
you know, that has happened and,

765
00:40:29.345 --> 00:40:31.965
and all the negatives, you know, and everything.

766
00:40:32.115 --> 00:40:34.445
It's like, oh, poor me, poor me, poor us.

767
00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:36.205
Look at us, you know, and,

768
00:40:36.425 --> 00:40:38.205
and we can be at that perspective.

769
00:40:39.345 --> 00:40:42.405
Um, and of course, that's not where God wants us to be.

770
00:40:42.465 --> 00:40:46.365
God wants us to live above our circumstances.

771
00:40:47.385 --> 00:40:48.485
So in, um,

772
00:40:52.175 --> 00:40:55.235
Old age, you know, I just had my birthday yesterday

773
00:40:55.375 --> 00:40:59.435
and, um, so in, uh,

774
00:40:59.615 --> 00:41:01.395
Romans 8 28,

775
00:41:02.215 --> 00:41:06.995
and we know that all things work together for good to those

776
00:41:07.055 --> 00:41:11.275
who love God, to those who are in the called according

777
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:12.435
to his purpose.

778
00:41:13.615 --> 00:41:16.475
And all things work together for good.

779
00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:20.995
All things, the hurt, the bad, the ugly

780
00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:23.675
that has taken place, that that took place.

781
00:41:24.135 --> 00:41:28.075
All these things work together for good.

782
00:41:29.135 --> 00:41:33.075
And, you know, we just, um, have to believe

783
00:41:33.345 --> 00:41:36.765
and know that we are called according to his purpose.

784
00:41:38.025 --> 00:41:41.685
And, um, another thing that I wanted to add to that,

785
00:41:41.685 --> 00:41:45.605
according to his purpose, is I started thinking about,

786
00:41:46.105 --> 00:41:50.805
you know, the whole entire process of, you know, um,

787
00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:52.605
shutting down everything.

788
00:41:52.705 --> 00:41:56.005
And then, you know, meeting in, uh, Vail's home

789
00:41:56.225 --> 00:41:59.925
and that whole, you know, um, um, scent life

790
00:42:00.025 --> 00:42:03.125
and df, you know, just walking alongside us and,

791
00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:07.485
and protecting us, you know, over, you know, um, keeping us

792
00:42:08.175 --> 00:42:10.405
under their wing, so to speak.

793
00:42:11.465 --> 00:42:15.325
And, um, and then the Friday night,

794
00:42:15.815 --> 00:42:19.725
we've been given a thrust to go to move forward.

795
00:42:19.945 --> 00:42:22.685
We, we can, we know where we're going now.

796
00:42:22.985 --> 00:42:26.045
We know what the, what, what the, what God's purpose is.

797
00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:28.245
And we're, we are in the middle of it.

798
00:42:28.985 --> 00:42:32.485
And the picture that I had, that I got, um,

799
00:42:32.515 --> 00:42:36.005
just this morning was a little child,

800
00:42:36.105 --> 00:42:38.645
and I'm sure everybody can relate in this room,

801
00:42:39.485 --> 00:42:42.485
a little child learning how to ride a bicycle.

802
00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:46.725
And first there's, you know, training wheels on and,

803
00:42:47.225 --> 00:42:49.605
and you're going along and there's training wheels.

804
00:42:50.075 --> 00:42:53.525
Well, that stage for us was when we were meeting in Vail's

805
00:42:53.525 --> 00:42:57.405
house, we were, we, we were going to church

806
00:42:57.515 --> 00:42:58.525
with training wheels.

807
00:42:59.065 --> 00:43:03.925
And then little by little, you take away that, that support

808
00:43:04.265 --> 00:43:07.685
and you kind of let you know, you let the child, you know,

809
00:43:07.715 --> 00:43:11.525
kind of, uh, ride the bicycle without the training wheels.

810
00:43:12.225 --> 00:43:15.325
And there's a lot of, you know, tipping over and falling

811
00:43:15.665 --> 00:43:16.965
and, and so forth.

812
00:43:17.105 --> 00:43:19.965
But then pretty soon they have confidence

813
00:43:20.185 --> 00:43:22.845
and they start sailing down the road by themselves

814
00:43:23.395 --> 00:43:25.485
without any training wheels.

815
00:43:25.905 --> 00:43:27.365
And we are in that process.

816
00:43:27.745 --> 00:43:31.205
We are where those training wheels are coming off,

817
00:43:32.025 --> 00:43:35.765
and we are going to be sailing down the road,

818
00:43:36.035 --> 00:43:38.205
down the hill up, you know, and,

819
00:43:38.545 --> 00:43:42.245
and we are, we are going to be riding with confidence

820
00:43:44.195 --> 00:43:47.245
towards that, towards that, you know, that, that future.

821
00:43:47.505 --> 00:43:50.925
And that's because we are in his purpose. Yeah.

822
00:43:51.135 --> 00:43:54.245
Right. That's good. Good.

823
00:43:57.225 --> 00:43:58.225
Joshua?

824
00:44:00.425 --> 00:44:04.805
Um, something I completely,

825
00:44:05.905 --> 00:44:09.805
um, kind of misunderstood for a long time was, um,

826
00:44:10.305 --> 00:44:11.725
the story of the carcass.

827
00:44:12.225 --> 00:44:14.605
Um, I've always looked at that as a bad thing.

828
00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:18.965
'cause um, this Sam, this with Samuel, um,

829
00:44:19.785 --> 00:44:22.125
before birth Samson, why did I say Samuel?

830
00:44:22.825 --> 00:44:24.685
Um, before birth?

831
00:44:26.075 --> 00:44:30.325
He's been following then, was it nite laws? Yeah. Mm-hmm.

832
00:44:30.745 --> 00:44:33.725
Um, which was, don't drink,

833
00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:36.565
don't touch a dead animal, don't cut your hair.

834
00:44:36.615 --> 00:44:39.365
Right. And I've always looked at that as like,

835
00:44:40.395 --> 00:44:42.125
like all the wrong he was doing.

836
00:44:42.585 --> 00:44:44.325
And it's, I've, I've looked at that.

837
00:44:44.595 --> 00:44:48.245
I've never heard it as I, the true beauty behind it.

838
00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:50.765
I've always seen like, oh, he is in a vineyard

839
00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:53.885
and he touches the, the lion he killed,

840
00:44:54.505 --> 00:44:56.605
and he, his hair gets cut.

841
00:44:56.605 --> 00:44:58.405
Mm-hmm. Like, he's just doing wrong. Mm-hmm.

842
00:44:58.665 --> 00:45:01.925
Um, and especially that story, I'm like,

843
00:45:02.145 --> 00:45:03.605
not only is he doing wrong

844
00:45:03.605 --> 00:45:05.285
by touching a da dead animal, right.

845
00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:07.765
But he's spreading that to his parents. Oh.

846
00:45:07.985 --> 00:45:11.845
And I've always, I've never, I, I guess the,

847
00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:18.005
the bigger picture of how, how it was something

848
00:45:18.475 --> 00:45:21.165
that I, I don't know, just the,

849
00:45:22.045 --> 00:45:26.565
I I guess it was like blinding my view of

850
00:45:26.865 --> 00:45:29.605
how God is transforming this story.

851
00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:32.085
And I was, um, I don't know.

852
00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:33.445
I I thought that was fascinating.

853
00:45:33.505 --> 00:45:36.925
And especially hearing at the start, I was like, I was like,

854
00:45:37.685 --> 00:45:39.845
I mean, I, I've never heard it that way.

855
00:45:39.945 --> 00:45:41.165
And I was like, what's going on?

856
00:45:41.195 --> 00:45:44.045
Like, is it, I thought that was a bad thing this whole time.

857
00:45:44.565 --> 00:45:48.965
Yeah. Wow. And now I'm like, oh, well, I mean, I was just

858
00:45:50.155 --> 00:45:51.685
kind of, kind of blinded.

859
00:45:51.945 --> 00:45:56.445
But, um, and then, I mean, and then he goes right after that

860
00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:58.165
and he is talking about sight.

861
00:45:58.505 --> 00:45:59.645
And I'm like, oh, wow.

862
00:45:59.715 --> 00:46:04.045
This is like, I, I've, I'm like, is he saying this?

863
00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:07.685
'cause I'm in the room, or I'm like,

864
00:46:08.235 --> 00:46:09.645
this is very, very direct.

865
00:46:09.795 --> 00:46:11.165
This is, uh, I just thought

866
00:46:11.165 --> 00:46:12.285
it was fascinating. That's awesome.

867
00:46:13.105 --> 00:46:17.165
Wow. That's so good. That's so good. All right.

868
00:46:17.185 --> 00:46:19.405
Oh, Jerry, you, you, you,

869
00:46:23.425 --> 00:46:25.285
Uh, When he's talking about building the temple

870
00:46:25.625 --> 00:46:28.725
and building the walls and how they, like

871
00:46:28.725 --> 00:46:29.885
where the individual stones

872
00:46:30.065 --> 00:46:31.245
and how they slotted together,

873
00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:33.645
there was no mortar, there was no cement.

874
00:46:34.225 --> 00:46:36.525
And how the buildings taking place place out in a quarry.

875
00:46:36.525 --> 00:46:37.925
So when our meetings and stuff like that,

876
00:46:38.025 --> 00:46:40.165
and just the importance of our personal life,

877
00:46:40.465 --> 00:46:44.325
our personal process of the things he even said he wants

878
00:46:44.325 --> 00:46:46.485
done here isn't the community itself.

879
00:46:46.485 --> 00:46:49.125
It's our individual walks that we're responsible for. Yeah.

880
00:46:49.275 --> 00:46:50.885
It's not anything you're gonna build, Greg.

881
00:46:50.995 --> 00:46:52.205
It's any is what we're building.

882
00:46:52.255 --> 00:46:53.405
Right. You're leading the way.

883
00:46:53.725 --> 00:46:57.005
Absolutely. That's it. Absolutely. Yep. Yep.

884
00:46:59.715 --> 00:47:00.715
Roberto,

885
00:47:03.775 --> 00:47:04.775
Thank you. Um,

886
00:47:04.775 --> 00:47:07.685
you know, a couple things that I, the, one

887
00:47:07.685 --> 00:47:10.085
of the main things I took away was just that moving forward,

888
00:47:10.155 --> 00:47:11.725
it's that motion and movement forward.

889
00:47:12.505 --> 00:47:14.845
And, um, you know, part of it was that story about the,

890
00:47:14.985 --> 00:47:19.445
the blocks and the how, how doc's apostolic function is

891
00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:21.205
that he know, he can see how things fit.

892
00:47:21.225 --> 00:47:23.325
He knows where, what order they go in

893
00:47:23.325 --> 00:47:27.005
and he knows, um, what belongs and what doesn't belong.

894
00:47:27.065 --> 00:47:29.885
And, and, um, and he said, you know, in that,

895
00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:31.645
in on Friday night, you know,

896
00:47:31.645 --> 00:47:33.285
there's no smell of smoke here.

897
00:47:33.665 --> 00:47:36.005
So there's, there's no smell of the carcass here at all.

898
00:47:36.185 --> 00:47:38.205
You guys are, he was basically, basically saying,

899
00:47:38.205 --> 00:47:39.525
you guys are clean, move forward.

900
00:47:40.265 --> 00:47:42.965
And, um, and both in our meeting on Thursday

901
00:47:43.025 --> 00:47:47.205
and then on Friday, that kind of moved into, um, you know,

902
00:47:47.205 --> 00:47:51.645
uh, uh, what's the next step with, with Greg, um, you know,

903
00:47:51.645 --> 00:47:53.405
and his process and coming in and,

904
00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:55.405
and this is what it's gonna look like,

905
00:47:55.585 --> 00:47:58.205
and this is about how long it's gonna take, they give

906
00:47:58.205 --> 00:47:59.205
or take, but this is, you know,

907
00:47:59.205 --> 00:48:00.565
gave us even kind of a timeline.

908
00:48:00.585 --> 00:48:02.525
And he even said that to us on Thursday when we were,

909
00:48:02.635 --> 00:48:03.685
when we were talking to him.

910
00:48:03.685 --> 00:48:08.165
And, and, um, and that was just so, um, I loved seeing

911
00:48:08.165 --> 00:48:09.605
that order that he could put in.

912
00:48:09.675 --> 00:48:11.005
He's, he was saying, look, here's

913
00:48:11.005 --> 00:48:12.165
what I've been given from God.

914
00:48:12.165 --> 00:48:13.845
Mm-hmm. Here's what my gifting is.

915
00:48:14.185 --> 00:48:16.645
And then, and then here's what it's gonna look like for,

916
00:48:16.825 --> 00:48:18.005
for you guys moving forward.

917
00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:20.085
So he kinda gave the context of his authority

918
00:48:20.385 --> 00:48:22.165
and then said, here's what it is.

919
00:48:22.295 --> 00:48:26.565
Right. And, um, that was just such a, a solidifying for,

920
00:48:26.785 --> 00:48:29.845
for I think me and for Natalie and our marriage and,

921
00:48:29.905 --> 00:48:32.845
and us moving forward as a community that, um,

922
00:48:32.875 --> 00:48:35.165
that just gave a reassurance and, um,

923
00:48:36.105 --> 00:48:40.205
and a solidness that, that was, uh, just, I,

924
00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:42.205
I don't know, I don't have a word for it.

925
00:48:42.205 --> 00:48:45.765
Beautiful. Awesome. Yeah. Encouraging edifying. Right.

926
00:48:45.985 --> 00:48:47.565
You know, all sorts of of words.

927
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:49.365
None of 'em really completely say it.

928
00:48:49.945 --> 00:48:54.765
And, um, and so that was, uh, for me, just the,

929
00:48:54.825 --> 00:48:57.165
the kind of, like Natalie said, the, the foundation of

930
00:48:57.165 --> 00:48:58.685
what he was doing for, for us.

931
00:48:58.825 --> 00:49:02.285
And then, you know, I love listening to the, the sharing

932
00:49:02.285 --> 00:49:04.885
because I get something each time and it sparks this.

933
00:49:04.885 --> 00:49:07.725
And I remember that. And, um, you know, Desi said something

934
00:49:07.725 --> 00:49:09.365
and it sparked something, and now I've lost it.

935
00:49:09.365 --> 00:49:12.445
So that one's gonna go, but, but it'll come back.

936
00:49:12.745 --> 00:49:15.445
But, um, you know, Jason said, you know, where Doc told him,

937
00:49:15.445 --> 00:49:18.805
if you, if you stay on that, on that, um, focusing on

938
00:49:18.805 --> 00:49:21.845
that carcass on the dead stuff, it creates a groove.

939
00:49:22.425 --> 00:49:26.285
And then that, that reminded me of, of the, um, uh,

940
00:49:26.345 --> 00:49:29.165
of the prophecy that, that Steve Schultz and,

941
00:49:29.305 --> 00:49:30.325
and Scott Webster.

942
00:49:30.345 --> 00:49:34.205
And, and, um, DF uh, when he gave that to me, he said,

943
00:49:34.335 --> 00:49:35.765
God's gonna sand all

944
00:49:35.765 --> 00:49:39.685
that down and regroup.

945
00:49:43.825 --> 00:49:45.085
And until today, I wasn't able

946
00:49:45.085 --> 00:49:46.565
to put those two things together. Yeah.

947
00:49:46.745 --> 00:49:49.645
Wow. So The prophecy keeps unfolding. Yeah.

948
00:49:50.005 --> 00:49:52.325
I thought it was then it had nothing to do with Right.

949
00:49:52.325 --> 00:49:54.285
Then it knew what was gonna happen. Yeah.

950
00:49:54.345 --> 00:49:57.285
It knew what all of that, and, um,

951
00:49:57.865 --> 00:49:59.605
and the purpose is the honey. Yeah.

952
00:49:59.985 --> 00:50:02.005
That's so good. Priscilla.

953
00:50:09.345 --> 00:50:12.525
Um, for, for me, one of the things that

954
00:50:13.765 --> 00:50:17.885
impacted me most, uh, when dog was, uh, sharing with us,

955
00:50:18.945 --> 00:50:20.725
uh, on even Thursday

956
00:50:20.945 --> 00:50:24.885
and Friday, was the common thread

957
00:50:24.885 --> 00:50:27.805
through the whole thing about, um, being accurate

958
00:50:28.265 --> 00:50:32.565
and building accurately and building accurate marriages

959
00:50:32.565 --> 00:50:35.925
and straightening your home first, and then your community.

960
00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:40.205
And, um, I, I feel like we're into the,

961
00:50:41.065 --> 00:50:45.285
the last four, uh, lanes, um, where we're hearing the voice

962
00:50:45.285 --> 00:50:49.645
of God clearly and confidently and, um, we're refreshed

963
00:50:49.645 --> 00:50:50.845
and renewed for a new thrust.

964
00:50:50.945 --> 00:50:54.365
And that's what happened Friday, where we are like, whoosh.

965
00:50:54.435 --> 00:50:56.165
Yeah. Push forward. Um,

966
00:50:58.225 --> 00:51:02.885
and, um, uh, finalized maturity where

967
00:51:03.645 --> 00:51:08.365
I feel like we have in the last 10 months have leaps

968
00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:11.525
and bounds of maturity and, uh, sorry.

969
00:51:12.985 --> 00:51:17.925
And, uh, there's this acceleration, uh, happening.

970
00:51:18.225 --> 00:51:22.765
You know, we have a six month window of acceleration and,

971
00:51:23.305 --> 00:51:26.525
but what he's calling us is to be exact in the, in that time

972
00:51:27.825 --> 00:51:29.165
and, um, accurate.

973
00:51:29.475 --> 00:51:32.165
Yeah. Good. Good.

974
00:51:34.905 --> 00:51:38.205
We need to hear from some of our, our Jacobs. Yeah,

975
00:51:39.405 --> 00:51:40.405
I got you.

976
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:44.565
Okay. Um, so something

977
00:51:44.565 --> 00:51:47.005
that Doc mentioned, um, was

978
00:51:47.155 --> 00:51:51.165
that the youth will become partners, um, in the execution

979
00:51:51.165 --> 00:51:54.045
of the journey and take up the mission for our God

980
00:51:54.045 --> 00:51:57.605
to be truly known as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

981
00:51:58.265 --> 00:52:00.725
Um, and so I think that, um,

982
00:52:02.265 --> 00:52:05.885
as God reveals our identity and gives us more sight

983
00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:09.365
and clarity on, um, our mission, um, in these next steps,

984
00:52:09.825 --> 00:52:13.005
I'm just, I'm just excited to get to know Andrew's God.

985
00:52:13.385 --> 00:52:15.605
Um, not everybody else is God. Yeah.

986
00:52:15.705 --> 00:52:19.805
Um, and just get to walk closer with him in pro,

987
00:52:19.915 --> 00:52:22.365
like closer in proximity to him, um,

988
00:52:23.185 --> 00:52:26.725
and just get to know him, um, personally.

989
00:52:27.385 --> 00:52:29.845
Um, and then of course just dialect with my brothers

990
00:52:29.845 --> 00:52:32.285
and, you know, learning, um, their process

991
00:52:32.745 --> 00:52:34.645
and, um, that just feeds into my process.

992
00:52:35.035 --> 00:52:36.125
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:52:36.555 --> 00:52:40.885
Yeah. Good. Absolutely. Judah.

994
00:52:47.225 --> 00:52:50.325
Uh, I like what Desi said, um, the reason

995
00:52:50.325 --> 00:52:51.485
for the carcass is the honey.

996
00:52:52.185 --> 00:52:55.205
And I always thought that like, all the bad things

997
00:52:55.365 --> 00:52:58.205
that happened to me were because I was being punished

998
00:52:58.385 --> 00:52:59.845
or hated or anything like that.

999
00:53:00.545 --> 00:53:02.045
But really it's just

1000
00:53:02.115 --> 00:53:04.365
because something good will come out of it.

1001
00:53:05.305 --> 00:53:08.685
And, um, once you forget about that carcass

1002
00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.045
or don't even know it was there,

1003
00:53:10.225 --> 00:53:11.885
it was like it never even happened.

1004
00:53:12.025 --> 00:53:15.045
Mm-hmm. Um, all you have is that fresh honey. Yeah.

1005
00:53:15.755 --> 00:53:18.485
It's so good. Excellent.

1006
00:53:22.315 --> 00:53:24.445
Yeah. Friday night just felt like a full

1007
00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:25.645
abolition of the past.

1008
00:53:25.795 --> 00:53:27.325
Like that the whole,

1009
00:53:27.355 --> 00:53:30.125
like having the carcass in our minds just went away.

1010
00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:31.805
It was just the honey that became the focus,

1011
00:53:32.505 --> 00:53:34.925
and especially him listing like the values of

1012
00:53:34.925 --> 00:53:37.205
what a community is, like, what the leaders are supposed

1013
00:53:37.205 --> 00:53:38.645
to be, what the women are supposed to be, and the men

1014
00:53:38.645 --> 00:53:40.925
and children and youth and everything.

1015
00:53:41.545 --> 00:53:42.645
And it's just so encouraging.

1016
00:53:42.805 --> 00:53:44.645
'cause that's what pure Congress is.

1017
00:53:44.745 --> 00:53:46.325
And I feel like now that we're moving forward,

1018
00:53:46.425 --> 00:53:49.405
we can walk in authenticity of what Congress is

1019
00:53:49.405 --> 00:53:51.125
and that what's what, that's what we didn't have before.

1020
00:53:51.155 --> 00:53:54.005
Yeah. And so it was just really encouraging

1021
00:53:54.025 --> 00:53:56.685
and exciting to hear, like, this is what I wanted.

1022
00:53:56.885 --> 00:53:58.885
'cause I've like traveled to other cases in the past too,

1023
00:53:58.885 --> 00:54:01.325
and like being part of prison, like I've gotten a taste of

1024
00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:04.285
what Congress is and then becoming CFG that got

1025
00:54:04.285 --> 00:54:06.365
to just drown in it.

1026
00:54:06.505 --> 00:54:08.645
And then now to move forward in like, our own process

1027
00:54:08.825 --> 00:54:10.845
of being KC and being fully Congress.

1028
00:54:10.845 --> 00:54:11.965
Yeah. It's just exciting.

1029
00:54:12.105 --> 00:54:13.885
So it was really just refreshing

1030
00:54:13.885 --> 00:54:16.165
and encouraging to hear Doc lay everything on,

1031
00:54:16.165 --> 00:54:17.325
and I'm excited to move forward in it.

1032
00:54:17.325 --> 00:54:18.325
Yeah. Good.

1033
00:54:21.295 --> 00:54:23.045
Kevin, Amber, or Jackie,

1034
00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:33.125
you can't escape.

1035
00:54:35.625 --> 00:54:39.405
Um, yeah, this was a really impactful week, I think

1036
00:54:39.475 --> 00:54:42.005
with our one-on-one with Doc.

1037
00:54:42.705 --> 00:54:46.285
Um, we came in with questions about GPS, you know,

1038
00:54:46.285 --> 00:54:49.125
what's we asked Doc, what's your heart for GPS?

1039
00:54:49.665 --> 00:54:52.285
And, um, he really just down poured into that.

1040
00:54:52.865 --> 00:54:53.925
And, um,

1041
00:54:54.575 --> 00:54:56.285
along the way he started asking

1042
00:54:56.305 --> 00:54:57.725
us questions about each other.

1043
00:54:58.035 --> 00:54:59.325
He's like, how long have you been married?

1044
00:54:59.385 --> 00:55:00.485
How many kids do you have?

1045
00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:05.245
And, um, and then the conversation just shifted to,

1046
00:55:05.905 --> 00:55:08.965
you know, when the Lord arrives, he's not gonna ask you

1047
00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:10.805
how well you led GPS.

1048
00:55:11.235 --> 00:55:14.325
He's gonna ask you, how well did you lead my daughter?

1049
00:55:14.585 --> 00:55:16.685
How well were you there for my son?

1050
00:55:16.985 --> 00:55:20.245
And there was just, I really understood calibration to a new

1051
00:55:20.785 --> 00:55:22.965
degree in the sense that as soon as he said

1052
00:55:22.965 --> 00:55:24.205
that, I was like, whoa.

1053
00:55:24.215 --> 00:55:26.845
There was this shift in me where I saw Kevin

1054
00:55:26.865 --> 00:55:30.285
and I running together, but not with our hands.

1055
00:55:30.345 --> 00:55:31.805
And our, our focuses everywhere,

1056
00:55:31.805 --> 00:55:34.125
but our, our sight fixated on each other.

1057
00:55:34.705 --> 00:55:36.565
And I, um, remembered the scripture

1058
00:55:36.595 --> 00:55:39.525
that Megan had said in the women's meeting of, um,

1059
00:55:39.635 --> 00:55:42.445
seek first the kingdom and all things will be added to you.

1060
00:55:42.785 --> 00:55:45.565
And there's just such a strong emphasis on marriages.

1061
00:55:45.635 --> 00:55:49.285
Like the Lord wants radiant marriages

1062
00:55:49.585 --> 00:55:54.565
for people coming in for the old, like there was such a, um,

1063
00:55:54.705 --> 00:55:58.205
an inaccurate structure there that broke apart, uh, uh,

1064
00:55:58.875 --> 00:56:01.245
what the enemy wanted to break apart a community,

1065
00:56:01.465 --> 00:56:02.925
but we came out thriving strong.

1066
00:56:02.925 --> 00:56:06.405
And so I just really heard like, as, as we build

1067
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.205
inside our marriage, as we see God's will,

1068
00:56:08.205 --> 00:56:09.925
everything else will be added to us.

1069
00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:12.445
You know, and that wasn't just for me and Kevin,

1070
00:56:12.585 --> 00:56:14.085
but that was for our community.

1071
00:56:14.115 --> 00:56:18.765
Like, there has to be that, that, um, stabilization there,

1072
00:56:18.825 --> 00:56:22.405
you know, and every conversation we had with Doc, um,

1073
00:56:23.105 --> 00:56:24.405
he referenced Mrs.

1074
00:56:24.405 --> 00:56:26.445
Woodruff, like, I have a wife at home.

1075
00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:27.845
She stabilizes our home.

1076
00:56:27.955 --> 00:56:29.645
This is how I'm able to do all these things.

1077
00:56:30.025 --> 00:56:33.245
And so as the Lord builds us, as our Hebron becomes strong,

1078
00:56:33.745 --> 00:56:37.005
the wall of our community, like there's a, a a call

1079
00:56:37.005 --> 00:56:39.205
for the women too to, to stand firm with them.

1080
00:56:39.225 --> 00:56:41.965
And so everything, everything just floated to

1081
00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.685
what we've been hearing these past six months.

1082
00:56:43.785 --> 00:56:44.885
So it was really good.

1083
00:56:46.715 --> 00:56:47.205
Awesome.

1084
00:56:51.455 --> 00:56:55.005
Kevin, just so

1085
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:56.965
Toby can get his steps in

1086
00:56:58.355 --> 00:57:01.885
Getting good exercise today, it's good.

1087
00:57:04.145 --> 00:57:06.245
Um, yeah. Then he'll go to you next.

1088
00:57:07.325 --> 00:57:10.685
I like this back and forth. It's nice. Good job, Toby.

1089
00:57:10.685 --> 00:57:13.685
You're doing a great job. Um, yeah.

1090
00:57:13.685 --> 00:57:16.405
Jackie really hit with our one-on-one meeting.

1091
00:57:17.345 --> 00:57:21.845
Um, how we had, I had, I developed a list

1092
00:57:21.845 --> 00:57:24.885
of questions and then I was like, okay, if, if I need

1093
00:57:24.885 --> 00:57:26.845
to use these questions, 'cause I don't wanna just go sit

1094
00:57:26.845 --> 00:57:28.325
down and stare at him awkwardly.

1095
00:57:28.915 --> 00:57:30.525
Like, I need to have questions ready.

1096
00:57:31.265 --> 00:57:33.685
And so, but I, I didn't even get, I got

1097
00:57:33.685 --> 00:57:34.805
to the first question, that was it.

1098
00:57:35.065 --> 00:57:36.965
And he began to talk about,

1099
00:57:37.305 --> 00:57:40.165
and when I was reflecting at first, I was like, oh man,

1100
00:57:40.205 --> 00:57:41.645
I didn't get to ask all these questions.

1101
00:57:42.345 --> 00:57:44.525
But then as I was reflecting over the meeting, I was like,

1102
00:57:44.525 --> 00:57:46.845
all these questions got answered in every area.

1103
00:57:47.245 --> 00:57:49.805
I had questions about GPS, I had questions about marriage,

1104
00:57:49.965 --> 00:57:51.165
I had questions about parenting.

1105
00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:54.365
And as he began to talk, and we, the meeting went on

1106
00:57:54.365 --> 00:57:56.365
and on, all of it got,

1107
00:57:56.655 --> 00:57:58.245
every question got answered without

1108
00:57:58.245 --> 00:57:59.525
even asking the question.

1109
00:57:59.555 --> 00:58:02.165
Yeah. It was like, it, it brought,

1110
00:58:02.225 --> 00:58:06.005
and I posted in my growth group a couple weeks ago how, um,

1111
00:58:06.155 --> 00:58:07.805
Jack and I were like, we were just like

1112
00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:09.205
exhausted a little bit.

1113
00:58:09.675 --> 00:58:11.925
Like we're, we're spread thin kind of,

1114
00:58:11.925 --> 00:58:15.125
and we're, we're trying and trying and expending energy

1115
00:58:15.125 --> 00:58:19.765
and expending energy, but just exhausted feeling like, like

1116
00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:23.285
physically and, and mentally and emotionally drained.

1117
00:58:24.065 --> 00:58:25.605
And that's when DF came in

1118
00:58:25.605 --> 00:58:26.885
and started talking about stillness.

1119
00:58:26.885 --> 00:58:30.165
And then, and then in this weekend, um,

1120
00:58:30.905 --> 00:58:32.405
on Friday doc talking about how

1121
00:58:32.965 --> 00:58:34.365
Congress was like this big block,

1122
00:58:34.505 --> 00:58:36.645
and then for two years it was like splintered

1123
00:58:36.645 --> 00:58:38.005
and it shot off in different things.

1124
00:58:38.585 --> 00:58:40.085
And then God took them through a process

1125
00:58:40.225 --> 00:58:42.925
and then he, it like, bring it all into,

1126
00:58:43.195 --> 00:58:45.685
they're just segments of one thing.

1127
00:58:46.545 --> 00:58:47.925
And it felt like all these,

1128
00:58:47.925 --> 00:58:49.325
like, I need to be a good husband.

1129
00:58:49.485 --> 00:58:51.245
I need to be a GPS leader.

1130
00:58:51.565 --> 00:58:52.685
I need to be good at work,

1131
00:58:52.785 --> 00:58:55.445
and I need to be, you know, helpful in the home,

1132
00:58:55.445 --> 00:58:56.965
and I need to be a good dad.

1133
00:58:56.985 --> 00:58:58.965
And what does that even mean? All this stuff.

1134
00:58:59.465 --> 00:59:01.605
It brought all those questions that I had brought,

1135
00:59:01.665 --> 00:59:04.765
got brought into a singularity of life where

1136
00:59:05.035 --> 00:59:07.685
through his authentic life and,

1137
00:59:08.385 --> 00:59:11.365
and him walking with God over the years and,

1138
00:59:11.425 --> 00:59:15.325
and this journey and us being grafted into that, it,

1139
00:59:15.505 --> 00:59:19.525
I'm also, my life is also becoming a singularity of, of

1140
00:59:20.225 --> 00:59:22.485
not being thrown out into all these different areas,

1141
00:59:22.665 --> 00:59:26.045
but like, just be the man that God wants you to be.

1142
00:59:26.465 --> 00:59:28.525
Be the husband at home that God wants you to be,

1143
00:59:28.745 --> 00:59:30.965
and everything else will flow Yeah.

1144
00:59:31.155 --> 00:59:35.205
Into that. And so, um, it answered all my questions

1145
00:59:35.205 --> 00:59:38.405
that brought me a lot of like, okay, confidence.

1146
00:59:38.435 --> 00:59:40.565
Like we can do this, we can do this.

1147
00:59:41.195 --> 00:59:45.325
Another thing that he hit on in our meeting as well was,

1148
00:59:46.265 --> 00:59:49.205
um, full community participation.

1149
00:59:50.155 --> 00:59:52.965
It's gonna take every single one of us here to build

1150
00:59:52.965 --> 00:59:54.045
what God wants us to build.

1151
00:59:54.625 --> 00:59:57.125
And so we have to all work and walk

1152
00:59:57.425 --> 01:00:00.445
and build together in oneness.

1153
01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:02.045
And, and that's the density.

1154
01:00:02.585 --> 01:00:06.245
And, um, he, he said, he said that to us, the, uh,

1155
01:00:07.025 --> 01:00:08.205
the Abraham, Isaac

1156
01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.845
and Jacob, the God of, he could have just stopped

1157
01:00:10.865 --> 01:00:14.405
by saying the God of Abraham, but it's all three

1158
01:00:14.585 --> 01:00:17.925
and God builds a community and it requires all of us.

1159
01:00:18.325 --> 01:00:21.925
Nobody's sitting on the sidelines, nobody having doubts.

1160
01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:24.405
I'm not good enough, or what about this situation?

1161
01:00:24.465 --> 01:00:27.685
Or it's, it's all of us walking together

1162
01:00:28.265 --> 01:00:31.165
and full participation from all of us to build

1163
01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:32.405
what God wants to build.

1164
01:00:33.065 --> 01:00:36.205
So that gave me sight on like moving forward.

1165
01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:39.125
I'm like, okay, we need to hear every voice.

1166
01:00:39.505 --> 01:00:42.205
So, um, yeah.

1167
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:46.045
And then also just meeting with him, I just saw

1168
01:00:46.665 --> 01:00:49.925
his authentic life, him and Aronde sitting and talking,

1169
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:53.725
and you just see the authenticity of how much they love God

1170
01:00:54.065 --> 01:00:55.925
and humans, the saints,

1171
01:00:57.035 --> 01:00:59.565
they really love people who love the saints.

1172
01:01:00.065 --> 01:01:03.005
And him talking here, like, you guys are the gold.

1173
01:01:03.465 --> 01:01:06.645
And it's just like so much identity being poured into us.

1174
01:01:06.905 --> 01:01:09.685
How, you know, we were never told we were the gold.

1175
01:01:10.265 --> 01:01:12.525
And now we get to walk in that in fullness.

1176
01:01:12.555 --> 01:01:13.965
Like, yeah, I am gold, you know,

1177
01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:15.885
put me in the rain and I don't rust.

1178
01:01:16.045 --> 01:01:17.965
I, I I have properties of gold. Yeah.

1179
01:01:18.145 --> 01:01:20.205
I'm, I'm God's children, you know?

1180
01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:24.685
Um, and then, sorry, I don't wanna set, uh,

1181
01:01:25.255 --> 01:01:26.765
share on and on and on,

1182
01:01:26.785 --> 01:01:30.205
but a ronde, um, he was

1183
01:01:31.075 --> 01:01:34.165
just quiet on the side for most of the time mm-hmm.

1184
01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:36.005
Until Doc was like, do you want to pray?

1185
01:01:36.505 --> 01:01:39.405
And then, holy moly, dude, what in the world?

1186
01:01:39.965 --> 01:01:42.325
I was like, whoa, where'd that come from?

1187
01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:46.005
I was like, oh my gosh, I want that.

1188
01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:50.165
I don't have to share and share and share

1189
01:01:50.185 --> 01:01:52.005
and like, you know, I could be quiet.

1190
01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:54.805
And when God calls me the density

1191
01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:57.125
and strength inside of him, wow.

1192
01:01:57.385 --> 01:01:59.565
I'm like, dude, I want to be like a rendez.

1193
01:02:00.545 --> 01:02:03.925
I'm like, oh my gosh. And then finally the last thing I

1194
01:02:03.925 --> 01:02:08.725
wanted to, um, share that I saw from Friday was in Arkansas.

1195
01:02:08.785 --> 01:02:10.125
He talked about the footsteps

1196
01:02:10.985 --> 01:02:13.245
and how we, we fall in the foot.

1197
01:02:13.265 --> 01:02:16.445
If you walking in the kingdom, if you look like on a beach,

1198
01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:17.725
there's a following Christ.

1199
01:02:17.725 --> 01:02:19.165
There's just one set of footprints.

1200
01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:21.565
And as a community, I felt

1201
01:02:21.675 --> 01:02:24.805
that we were like taking our first footprint

1202
01:02:24.805 --> 01:02:26.605
that wasn't gonna make a, a mess.

1203
01:02:26.665 --> 01:02:29.805
You know, that wasn't gonna make like a imprint perfectly.

1204
01:02:30.305 --> 01:02:31.445
It was perfectly in line.

1205
01:02:31.825 --> 01:02:36.245
And it, it just felt like, like we were taking a step

1206
01:02:36.865 --> 01:02:40.685
in accuracy and strength and, and confidence.

1207
01:02:40.705 --> 01:02:43.645
And um, and I remember inside of

1208
01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:45.245
that talking about the footsteps.

1209
01:02:45.305 --> 01:02:48.405
He, um, he talked about there's, there's more to come.

1210
01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.845
And as he was talking about his journey, I'm like, yeah,

1211
01:02:50.855 --> 01:02:52.725
we're, we're, those were those extra

1212
01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:54.245
the more that were to come.

1213
01:02:54.745 --> 01:02:57.805
But then, you know, God also reminded me

1214
01:02:57.805 --> 01:02:58.965
that there's more after us too.

1215
01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:02.165
And so to build in, in accuracy to make sure

1216
01:03:02.165 --> 01:03:04.205
that our footsteps are properly aligned.

1217
01:03:04.585 --> 01:03:06.445
But then inside of that, it's just like, we just have

1218
01:03:06.445 --> 01:03:08.805
to follow, keep following the footprints. So, yeah.

1219
01:03:09.555 --> 01:03:13.725
Good. Um, as Amber shares,

1220
01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:19.645
we'll someone, uh, go get the kids and,

1221
01:03:20.545 --> 01:03:23.725
and someone go get the, the communion.

1222
01:03:30.985 --> 01:03:35.165
All right. So, um, yeah,

1223
01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:36.565
this weekend was really impactful.

1224
01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:41.125
Um, I feel like every time,

1225
01:03:42.065 --> 01:03:46.085
um, I hear Doc speak for whatever reason,

1226
01:03:46.325 --> 01:03:49.605
I end up going back into the prophetic word that we got from

1227
01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:53.565
Steve and Scott, um, and David.

1228
01:03:54.385 --> 01:03:58.845
Um, and one of the things that, uh, Steve said to Jerry

1229
01:03:58.905 --> 01:04:01.245
and I, um, was that we

1230
01:04:01.945 --> 01:04:04.085
had very fuzzy architecture

1231
01:04:04.705 --> 01:04:06.725
and that we were coming from places of chaos.

1232
01:04:07.665 --> 01:04:11.885
Um, and I've never, I,

1233
01:04:12.205 --> 01:04:14.485
I didn't really understand that at the time.

1234
01:04:14.955 --> 01:04:19.245
Like I didn't have the best, uh, childhood, I guess,

1235
01:04:19.385 --> 01:04:21.325
but it, that also didn't really fit.

1236
01:04:21.985 --> 01:04:25.445
Um, and so after this last year

1237
01:04:25.825 --> 01:04:28.765
and just everything that we've experienced, like that was,

1238
01:04:29.675 --> 01:04:31.165
that was the fuzzy architecture.

1239
01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:33.085
That was the chaos we were coming from.

1240
01:04:33.945 --> 01:04:37.805
Um, my, uh,

1241
01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:40.965
I think it was Davin actually that said something like, uh,

1242
01:04:41.235 --> 01:04:43.405
when people would ask you, why are you still at this church?

1243
01:04:43.475 --> 01:04:45.605
Well, because God hasn't told me to move.

1244
01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:49.405
Um, I started thinking about that

1245
01:04:49.425 --> 01:04:52.165
and was like, man, we've been here for a long time

1246
01:04:52.465 --> 01:04:56.085
and I don't really know why there's not, there's not,

1247
01:04:57.425 --> 01:05:00.125
you know, God hasn't said, you know, you're here

1248
01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:01.205
for this reason or whatever.

1249
01:05:01.205 --> 01:05:03.485
It was just kind of quiet and waiting.

1250
01:05:04.545 --> 01:05:07.365
Um, but then after this weekend and,

1251
01:05:07.985 --> 01:05:11.645
and remembering what Steve Schultz said to us, and

1252
01:05:12.335 --> 01:05:15.765
after hearing the announcement about you, Greg, um,

1253
01:05:16.825 --> 01:05:19.285
my spirit was just like, oh, this is,

1254
01:05:20.035 --> 01:05:21.325
this is what you've been waiting for.

1255
01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:22.725
This is why you were placed here.

1256
01:05:23.555 --> 01:05:26.565
This is what we've, this is what we've been waiting for.

1257
01:05:27.025 --> 01:05:31.285
And it's, I'm just, I'm really excited, really excited.

1258
01:05:31.635 --> 01:05:33.325
Good. Awesome.

1259
01:05:38.655 --> 01:05:42.165
While Kevin was talking. Hello.

1260
01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:44.645
Check, check, check, check, check.

1261
01:05:45.135 --> 01:05:47.765
While, uh, Kevin was talking,

1262
01:05:55.075 --> 01:05:56.015
we need everybody.

1263
01:05:56.755 --> 01:06:01.425
Yes. Nothing moves

1264
01:06:01.655 --> 01:06:03.185
without everybody.

1265
01:06:05.705 --> 01:06:08.545
Connor's just as significant as, as I am.

1266
01:06:08.605 --> 01:06:12.825
And, and Solo has a, has a purpose

1267
01:06:13.085 --> 01:06:13.905
and Peter,

1268
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.665
so I don't want them just to be in the room

1269
01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:42.105
by themselves and we just do whatever,

1270
01:06:42.645 --> 01:06:44.945
but I want them to be part of this.

1271
01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:45.665
Yeah.

1272
01:07:11.065 --> 01:07:14.385
I don't want to look at the kids as Oh, they're just kids.

1273
01:07:16.725 --> 01:07:21.225
You know, I think of a, a prophetic vision

1274
01:07:21.295 --> 01:07:24.145
that one of the Uri girls had very significant

1275
01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:31.745
What dreams, what visions can Lana have or Connor have?

1276
01:07:32.165 --> 01:07:33.185
Or, or

1277
01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:41.185
I got something.

1278
01:07:47.015 --> 01:07:49.385
They're gold. That's right.

1279
01:07:51.245 --> 01:07:52.865
He said, take care of the gold.

1280
01:07:57.135 --> 01:08:00.105
Yeah. Gold. And

1281
01:08:06.955 --> 01:08:09.615
the we're generational.

1282
01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:12.815
You know, the, the kids need a bob,

1283
01:08:14.725 --> 01:08:16.005
they need a Griselda.

1284
01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:22.365
They're watching, they're watching you already.

1285
01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:27.245
And so we just pass by them and, and oh, it's just a kid.

1286
01:08:28.025 --> 01:08:30.725
But the touch of, of, of you

1287
01:08:31.265 --> 01:08:35.445
and imprinting into their lives can, what can that do

1288
01:08:35.505 --> 01:08:39.525
for them going up to the youth and,

1289
01:08:40.545 --> 01:08:43.885
and sharing life with, with the youth,

1290
01:08:44.105 --> 01:08:47.845
and they're like, doc told Kevin

1291
01:08:47.865 --> 01:08:49.845
and Jackie, the kids are watching you.

1292
01:08:49.915 --> 01:08:53.325
They're scanning you. They're, and that's our lives.

1293
01:08:53.325 --> 01:08:57.245
They're scanning us. I want to be a pattern. Yeah.

1294
01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:00.485
Not just for my kids, but for your kids

1295
01:09:01.385 --> 01:09:02.605
and the kids that come in.

1296
01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:06.525
I want, I want them to go, I want to smell, I want to look,

1297
01:09:06.645 --> 01:09:07.845
I want to follow that.

1298
01:09:08.195 --> 01:09:08.485
Yeah.

1299
01:09:13.505 --> 01:09:16.805
So let's take

1300
01:09:19.345 --> 01:09:22.925
the bread and thank God

1301
01:09:23.105 --> 01:09:26.125
for just what he's doing.

1302
01:09:28.225 --> 01:09:30.205
The journey that we're on and,

1303
01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:33.525
and the, the movement forward that we're,

1304
01:09:33.695 --> 01:09:35.285
we're projected into.

1305
01:09:35.665 --> 01:09:38.925
Doc, doc told me in, in Trinidad, I was,

1306
01:09:39.005 --> 01:09:40.165
I, I'm like a slingshot.

1307
01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:41.805
I was pulled back into darkness.

1308
01:09:42.025 --> 01:09:44.765
But wait until you get let, let go of

1309
01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:50.365
and the projection forward, he goes, watch out

1310
01:09:53.905 --> 01:09:54.125
So

1311
01:10:05.415 --> 01:10:06.795
dearly father, we stand here

1312
01:10:06.815 --> 01:10:11.315
and utter awe of what you're doing and, and,

1313
01:10:11.535 --> 01:10:12.995
and doing in our church.

1314
01:10:13.065 --> 01:10:17.555
Lord God, what you're, what you're about

1315
01:10:17.555 --> 01:10:19.995
to build and, and wanting to do.

1316
01:10:19.995 --> 01:10:22.475
Lord God. We, we don't take that lightly.

1317
01:10:22.495 --> 01:10:26.875
But Father God, I pray that, that we would steward your,

1318
01:10:27.305 --> 01:10:28.755
your, uh, desires.

1319
01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:29.955
Well, yes. God.

1320
01:10:30.255 --> 01:10:34.875
God, I, I pray like, like doc, that whatever you, you ask,

1321
01:10:35.095 --> 01:10:38.595
we do, we do it with joy and, and, and hope

1322
01:10:38.695 --> 01:10:39.835
or God and, and peace.

1323
01:10:40.015 --> 01:10:43.355
Yes. Yes. Father God, I pray that, that, uh,

1324
01:10:45.785 --> 01:10:47.315
your will will be done. Yes.

1325
01:10:47.615 --> 01:10:49.875
Yes. Yes. God.

1326
01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:55.435
I'm just a, a servant saying, I'm, I'm willing,

1327
01:11:01.055 --> 01:11:04.955
I'm willing to, to do what you want to do and, and,

1328
01:11:05.055 --> 01:11:07.395
and say what you want to be said, Lord God.

1329
01:11:07.395 --> 01:11:10.195
And, and go where you want me to go, father God.

1330
01:11:10.195 --> 01:11:13.925
And I pray God, that, that, that you would go

1331
01:11:13.925 --> 01:11:16.885
before this church and, and we would follow exactly.

1332
01:11:17.025 --> 01:11:18.725
In your footsteps. Yes.

1333
01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:21.605
We wouldn't deviate to the right or to the left, father God,

1334
01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.965
but we would stay exactly where you want us to be.

1335
01:11:25.065 --> 01:11:28.285
We don't go in arrogance and, and, uh, a haughtiness,

1336
01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.805
but Lord God, we go humbly.

1337
01:11:30.105 --> 01:11:32.005
Yes. Father God, I pray

1338
01:11:32.005 --> 01:11:33.965
that you would just be with us, father God.

1339
01:11:34.065 --> 01:11:37.165
Yes. We won't move unless you move. Yes.

1340
01:11:37.425 --> 01:11:42.285
God, Lord, God. You're, you're,

1341
01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:44.845
You're, You're our substance.

1342
01:11:44.845 --> 01:11:45.885
You're our bread. Yes.

1343
01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:52.245
And we're just thankful.

1344
01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:54.685
Yes, Phil. Great.

1345
01:11:55.065 --> 01:11:56.645
I'm, I'm, I'm just thankful

1346
01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:59.125
that Thank you that you're doing.

1347
01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.805
Thank you, Lord, what you're doing. Yes.

1348
01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:07.085
You, We

1349
01:12:07.085 --> 01:12:08.285
partner with you Jesus.

1350
01:12:09.345 --> 01:12:13.245
Yes. We just partner with you in your living name. Yes.

1351
01:12:14.475 --> 01:12:16.885
Amen. Partake.

1352
01:12:40.835 --> 01:12:42.515
I think that's a beautiful place to stop.

1353
01:12:52.905 --> 01:12:55.765
So come next week,

1354
01:12:57.705 --> 01:13:02.045
uh, expecting, hopeful,

1355
01:13:03.225 --> 01:13:07.325
joyful, and have a blessed week.
